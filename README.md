# portfolio

## description:
The goal was to recreate a basic web dev portfolio referencing a stylesheet.

You can explore the site [here](https://chenallee.github.io/portfolio/index.html).

## made:
In Visual Studio using:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. :new: Flexbox :new:

## final thoughts:
I have worked with HTML and CSS before, but after learning CSS syntax, I promptly started relying on Bootstrap. As someone who wants to focus on front-end roles that is something I definitely need to rectify!

I have always had issues understanding positioning in CSS. I was excited to learn how to use flexbox myself, but it was my first time working with it so it took me a bit of research and experimentation to become familiar with it.

I also decided to completely reorganize my CSS file to practice implementing style classes that I can reuse on different elements. I'm still not comfortable with what best practice should be here. 

For example, in the case where I wanted to fix both the footer and the card titles to the bottom of each of their containers, I had to decide whether to type out:
```css
 margin-top: auto;
```
multiple times in the css file or nest it within a class that I applied to the appropriate elements. I went with the latter this time.

Going forward, I'll continue to look into best practices with CSS styling so I can build my front-end skills.
